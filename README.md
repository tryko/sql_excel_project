Pivot Tables

    Create a Pivot table per each country. Show the number of items sold.

    Show the same metric as percentage out of total

    Show this data only for English speaking buyers

    Show this result only for Facebook campaigns

*Create a new table and add there only the relevant info for every order in the A/B test area

    In the new file you have cost per customer for each campaign and use excel functions to get total cost for each campaign.

    Create 4 different charts of these types:

    Bar

    Line plot

    Scatter

    Pie

Please think what is the best way to represent these 4 graphs in the data, at least 1 of them with a dual y-axis. Please make sure that your labels and legends are correct and make sense (e.g. percentage will be like 78.19% and not 0.7819 and make sure each axis have a proper name)  

    Please check that there are no duplicates values if there are mark them in orange

    In a separate sheet choose a specific country or category and sort the data by year then by quarter and lastly by date (you will have to create an additional column for this task).

    Choose a country or campaign and use conditional formatting to color the highest order in your preferred color

    Create a new key that includes the name of the item and the country and check for the new key the highest sold item.

    Pick a test that you like and choose whether the users in B had better results then the users in A for the company

    If you have other methods or metrics that you would like to use feel free to use them here!
